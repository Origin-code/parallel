To compile and run:

1. Run make first to compile - run make clean first if necessary

2. Change any inputs in Makefile before running - examples and explanations in Makefile for ease of use

3. make run-random or chosen benchmark mode to run simulation

4. python3 plot.py output.tsv output.pdf to plot data
